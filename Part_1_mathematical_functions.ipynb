And while from an outsider's perspective their usage in the field may seem to astound, arising in un-ending variation, insiders learn to appreciate how these many variations arise as small (albeit sometimes quite clever) twists on a handful of fundamental ideas.  Indeed we will see that such a statement applies equally well to other major technical tools and frameworks used in machine learning / deep learning as well, particularly those which use mathematical functions as a basic building block.

We start to see each row as a *datapoint*, consisting of one input value and one output value, or taken together an *input/output pair*.  For example the first row contains a datapoint or input/output pair $(\\text{Year},\\text{Revenue}) = (2005,19.12)$, the second row $(\\text{Year},\\text{Revenue}) = (2006,20.90)$, and so on.\n",
